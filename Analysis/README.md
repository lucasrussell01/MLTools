# Analysis

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

`save_column.py` will save a column of a dataframe (by default `mvis`) and the weights to a dictionary. This is useful to efficiently plot distributions later.

`plot_histo.py` will read in a dictionary and plot the distribution (with weights).

`ShuffleMerge.py` will add truth lables and mix different classes for training.
